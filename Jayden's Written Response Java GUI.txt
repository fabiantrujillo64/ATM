So when we first started off this project, my partner and I started doing the basics, which was making the window and making buttons for our ATM Project. After we created the window and the three buttons, “Check Balance”, “Withdraw”, and “Deposit” we then started to make a menu bar for our project. A problem me and my partner had was making a dialog box for a sign out button on the menu bar, which would be a yes or no option to close the program. The “Yes” button in the dialog box would work, but every time we would press no or the x on the upper right corner, it would close, which is what we both didn’t want. We then fixed our problem by making a different variable, “dialogResult” instead of “dialogButton” and we would make dialogResult equal to 0 and we figured our problem out. Me and my partner both had jobs to do, I would create the menu bar button action listeners for dialog boxes and my partner would do the math functions for our ATM Project to make it a proper ATM.
